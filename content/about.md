## Hello stranger, I hope you enjoy your stay

I'm Andrew McLean and I currently work as an SDET at the MathWorks in Cambridge, UK. This is mostly a blog for my investigations into the ugly parts of the languages I use day-to-day, i.e C++ and JavaScript, however I'll write about most things that capture my interest.
